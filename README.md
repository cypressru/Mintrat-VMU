![alt text](https://github.com/cypressru/mintrat-vmu/blob/main/mintratvmu.png?raw=true)

Mintrat VMU is a tool you can use to make low resolution images and export them as arrays in C code to be used with KallistiOS on the VMU, bypassing the need to make .pngs, or making a 1 bit bitmap (of an exact filesize).

Features :
You can create multiple images (arrays) that are smaller than the VMUs total resolution, allowing some flexibility in how you utilize your VMUs screen space.  
Basic tools like draw, fill, erase.
Exports as a .c file with an array.
